indexing

yeah we introduce indexing in large data set tables 
instead of query we use stroeproc 

some juniors also work wih me they did query like select all records I've mention to retrevive only needed records from DB, 

introdue goorm also


channels:
    -   channel in used to communicate between multiple go routines.
    -   it is communication mechanism that enables to send the values one go routines to another go routines.
    -   It has two types of channels buffered and unbuffered channels.
    -   buffered channels mwe can store only certain number of values it has a capacity.
    -   Unbuffered channel we can store only a single value.
    -   For/select is used to receive the multiple go routines values.
    -   we can create a channel using make funtion.
